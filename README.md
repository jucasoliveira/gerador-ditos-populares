## Introdution

This is an exercise , using a dummy idea to produce a POC of a feature.

## What is this POC

A few days ago , i saw this tweet

![0eef6930-43db-4b3a-a8e0-6dd0b16e4367](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11979969/147813395-b7313064-9ad4-48b8-a829-febb95984f0b.jpeg)


In this tweet , written in portuguese, is stated that a popular brazilian saying is easily created, following a set of rule:

1. The phrase must start with a animal name
2. folowed by an adjective to thie animal
3. added the word no
4. followed by a verb
5. and finished with an adverb of time, place or mood.


This set of rules got me thinking and I've created this application , with hardcoded data to generate completely random strings for each rule.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
